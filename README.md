# Predicting the Odds of Winning a Match in the First Round of Australia Open 2017
Tennis is one of the most commercialized sports. More than 100 Association of Tennis Professionals
(ATP) tours are hosted by different cities all over the world each year, and a ticket to one
single game may cost more than $7,000 (per the record in 2018, the highest price was $7,882).
The performance of players has been passionately investigated and discussed by many sport TV
programs, professionals, and fans. In support of the discussion, ATP released a series of data regarding
players' performance in the end of each match. In this project, I used the performance
data from the first round of match in Australia Open 2017. There were 128 players, half of whom
won the match, and the performance was recorded in 10 variables. The aim of this project is to
identify the performance factors that are significantly associated with the result of match, i.e.,
win or loss.
