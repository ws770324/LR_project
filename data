Data Manipulation and Summary Statistics
Except age (in years), all the performance data are counts of a specific event. Since the count may be affected by the number of games played, I computed the rates of (1) first serve winning, (2) second serve winning, and (3) break point saving following the formulas below:
\mathrm{Second\ serve\ points\ lost\ =\ Total\ serve\ points\ won}-\mathrm{First\ serve\ points\ won\bigm}\mathrm{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }-\mathrm{Second\ serve\ points\ won}-\mathrm{Double\ fault\ }
\mathrm{First\ serve\ winning\ rate\ =\ }\frac{\mathrm{First\ serve\ points\ won}}{\mathrm{First\ serve\ success}}
\mathrm{Second\ serve\ winning\ rate\ =\ }\frac{\mathrm{Second\ serve\ points\ won}}{\mathrm{(Second\ serve\ points\ won\ +\ Second\ serve\ points\ lost)}}
\mathrm{Break\ point\ saving\ rate\ =\ }\frac{\mathrm{Break\ points\ saved}}{\mathrm{Break\ points\ faced}}
If a player faced no break point, the break point saving rate was set to 1 based on the assumption that if this player had faced break points he could have save them all. This is a reasonable assumption because facing no break point implies this player is not stressed by his opponent and has greater performance.  
The means of these variables were compared between winners and losers using two-sample Student's t-test (shown in the table below).
